# TODO List

- [x] Add React project and integrate it with TypeScript.
- [x] Introduce WebPack and connect it with React and TypeScript.
- [x] Introduce Tailwind.
- [ ] Configure GitHub Actions to use GitHub Pages. So the built web site will be deployed on GitHub Pages.
- [ ] Mimic the index page of https://tekstika.ee/, demo version. For demo, it does not communicate with the server so the frontend can complete it. (try not to see my original codes as much as possible).

## For better git commit message

##### example format

[tag] \<what you changed\>

\<why you change\>

\<any other information\>

##### example

[Index Page] Make the Nav responsible to screen size.

Layout was collapsed on smart phone screen.

Maybe better with "hamburger" button?
